#' Sea urchins biometry
#'
#' Various measurement on *Paracentrotus lividus* sea urchins providing from
#' fishery (Brittany, France), or from a sea urchins farm in Normandy.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 19 variables:
#' \describe{
#' \item{\code{origin}}{A **factor** with two levels: `"Culture"`, and
#'    `"Fishery"`.}
#' \item{\code{diameter1}}{Diameter (in mm) of the test measured at the ambitus
#'   (its widest part).}
#' \item{\code{diameter2}}{A second diameter (in mm) measured at the ambitus,
#'   perpendicular to the first one. The idea here is to calculate the average
#'   of `diameter1` and `diameter2` in order to eliminate the effect of possible
#'   slight departure from a nearly circular ambitus.}
#' \item{\code{height}}{The height of the test (in mm), measured from month to
#' anus, thus, orthogonally to the two diameters.}
#' \item{\code{buoyant_weight}}{Weight (in g) of the sea urchin immersed in
#'   seawater.}
#' \item{\code{weight}}{Weight (in g) of the whole animal.}
#' \item{\code{solid_parts}}{Weight (in g) of the animal after draining its
#'   coelomic fluid out of the test.}
#' \item{\code{integuments}}{Weight (in g) of the sea urchin after taking out
#'   the whole content of the test (coelomic fluid, digestive tract and gonads.}
#' \item{\code{dry_integuments}}{Dry weight (in g) of the integuments.}
#' \item{\code{digestive_tract}}{Weight (in g) of the digestive tract,
#'   including its content.}
#' \item{\code{dry_digestive_tract}}{Dry weight (in g) of the digestive tract
#'   and its content.}
#' \item{\code{gonads}}{Weight (in g) of the gonads.}
#' \item{\code{dry_gonads}}{Dry weight (in g) of the gonads.}
#' \item{\code{skeleton}}{Weight of the skeleton (g), calculated as the sum of
#'  lantern + test + spines.}
#' \item{\code{lantern}}{Dry weight (in g) of the lantern (the jaw and teeth of
#'   the sea urchin).}
#' \item{\code{test}}{Dry weight (in g) of the calcareous part of the test.}
#' \item{\code{spines}}{Dry weight (in g) of calcareous parts of the spines.}
#' \item{\code{maturity}}{Gonads maturity index (integer), measured on a scale
#'  of 3 states: state 0 means the gonad is absent or spent, state 1 means it is
#'  growing but not mature, and state 2 means the gonad is mature. This should
#'  be treated as a circular variable, since the reproductive cycle is 0 -> 1
#'  -> 2 -> 0 (spawning).}
#' \item{\code{sex}}{When it is possible, the sex of the animal is determined by
#'   visual inspection of the gonads (**factor** with levels `"F"` and `"M"`).}
#' }
#'
#' A stratified sample was performed to make sure all size classes (from 5 to 5
#' mm in test diameter) from each sub-population are equally represented in the
#' dataset. Hence, the size or weight-classes distributions among each
#' population **cannot** be studied with this dataset. However, those data are
#' more suitable to explore allometric relationships between body measurements
#' and/or body parts of the sea urchins over the whole size range.

#' Sea urchins growth
#'
#' Size at age for a cohort of farmed sea urchins, *Paracentrotus lividus*.
#'
#' The same cohort of farmed sea urchins being measured at various time
#' intervals, the observations are not completely independent from each other:
#' the same individuals are repeatedly measured here. As the sea urchins are
#' not individually tagged, it is not possible to track them from one
#' measurement to the other. However, the whole dataset is representative of the
#' growth, and spreading of growth in a single cohort. Also, mortality could be
#' derived from the number of measurements made at each time period, since
#' **all** the individuals still alive are measured (no sub-sampling).

#'   `Poecilostomatoid` and they represent the most abundant zooplankton at sea.

#'
#' This is a typical training set used to train a plankton classifier with
#' machine learning algorithms. Organisms originate from various samples
#' (different seasons, depth, etc. to take the variability into account).
#' However, the abundance of the different classes do **not** match abundance
#' found in each sample, i.e., rare classes are over-represented in this
#' training set. Only zooplankton classes are present in the dataset. Full data
#' also contains classes for phytoplankton, marine snow, etc. Take care that
#' several variables are correlated!
