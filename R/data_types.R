#' List recognized file formats (types) for read() and write()
#'
#' @param types_only If `TRUE`, only a vector of types is returned, otherwise,
#' a `tibble` with full specifications is provided.
#' @param view If `TRUE`, the result is "viewed" (displayed in a table in a
#' separate window, if the user interface allows it, e.g., in RStudio) and
#' returned invisibly. Otherwise, the results are returned normally.
#'
#' @description Display information about data types that can read() and write()
#' can use, as well as, the original functions that are delegated (see they
#' respective help pages for more info and to know which additional parameters
#' can be used in read() and write()).
#'
#' @return An `tibble` with `types_only = FALSE`, or a character vector.
#' @details The function is mainly designed to be used interactively and to
#' provide information about file types that can be read() or write(). This
#' cannot be done through a man page because this list is dynamic and other
#' packages could add or change entries there. With `view = FALSE`, the function
#' can, nevertheless, be also used in a script or a R Markdown/Notebook
#' document.
